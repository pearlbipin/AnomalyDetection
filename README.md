Anomaly Detection Algorithm for Elliptical Clusters Based On Maximum Cluster Diameter Criteria

This simplified algorithm provides a quick method to determine if a point lies outside an ellipse. Instead of
 calculating the Euclidean distances between the anomaly point and the endpoints of the major and minor
 axes, we simply compute the differences in the x and y coordinates. This method reduces computational
 intensity at the expense of accuracy.
